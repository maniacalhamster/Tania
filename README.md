# Overview

Attempt to consolidate my understanding and strenghten my familiarity with the web tech core - HTML, CSS, JS. 

I had originally stumbled onto [Tania's Blog](https://tania.dev) whilst trying to [learn how React works](https://tania.dev/getting-started-with-react/) (directed by React's site actually)! I was instantly surprised and delighted by Tania's writing - both in the style and the topics that she covers. The blog was described as a "digital garden" and quite a garden it was :)

Getting back on track, I decided to gain a firm grasp of the core tech before diving into learning all the shiny new tools that're ubiquitous throughout the industry.

Tania's blog has been a resource that I hold in high regard and I used extensively in my journey to learn core web tech - particularly the blogs on [CSS Fundamentals](https://tania.dev/overview-of-css-concepts/) and on [Responsive Design Fundamentals](https://www.taniarascia.com/you-dont-need-a-framework/).

I sought to apply what I've learned by reproducing Tania's main page via bare HTML/CSS/JS. The purpose of this repository is to help document by progress and mark milestones important to me.
